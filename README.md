## 📊 IPL Match Stats Explorer (2008–2020)

A complete data analysis project based on the **IPL Complete Dataset (2008–2020)**. This project explores batting and bowling performance trends such as **strike rate**, **economy rate**, **toss vs win relationship**, and **player performance insights**, all done **without using Python** — using **MS Excel** for data cleaning, pivot tables, and visualisations.

### 📊 Key KPIs Calculated

#### 🔹 **Strike Rate (Batsmen)**

> **Formula:** `(Total Runs / Balls Faced) * 100`
> Extras like wide balls are excluded.

#### 🔹 **Economy Rate (Bowlers)**

> **Formula:** `(Total Runs Conceded / Legal Deliveries) * 6`
> Only legal deliveries are counted (excluding wides and no-balls).

#### 🔹 **Toss Impact**

* Compared toss winners and match winners
* Analysed how often toss-winning teams also win the match

### 📌 Tools Used

* 📄 **Excel**
* 📊 **Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts**
* 📉 **Bar, Line, and Pie Charts**
* 📚 **Dataset from Kaggle**

### 📷 Sample Visualisations

Include screenshots or add links to:

* ✅ Top batsmen by strike rate
* ✅ Top bowlers by economy
* ✅ Win rate comparison
* ✅ Toss vs Match outcome bar chart

### 🧠 Insights Discovered

* Certain teams win the toss but lose more often.
* Players like \[insert name] maintain consistently high strike rates across seasons.
* Bowlers with the best economy often aren't the highest wicket-takers.
